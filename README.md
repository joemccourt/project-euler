== About ==
This is a collection of my solutions to project euler problems.  More for fun and bragging rights than anything else.

== Running Code ==
You can run my code by opening index.html into a browser and typing the following into the console (where N is the problem number):
	var prob = new ProbN();
	prob.eval();
